    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Well, this one is an obvious favorite. Who doesn't like mac and cheese? If you don't, then why the heck are you even here?</p>
        
    <p>I don't know why you're even reading this part. Just skip ahead to the recipe. Oh, and friendly reminder,
        gluttony is a cardinal sin. Tweet tweet.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb. dried elbow pasta</li>
        <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups whole milk</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups half and half</li>
        <li>4 cups grated medium sharp cheddar <em>divided</em></li>
        <li>2 cups grated Gruyere cheese <em>divided</em></li>
        <li>1/2 Tbsp salt</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp black pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp paprika</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees F and grease a 3 quart baking dish (9"x13"). Set aside.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. When boiling, add dried pasta and cook for 1 minute less
            than the package directs for al dente. Drain and drizzle with a little bit of olive oil to keep from sticking.</li>
        <li>While water is coming up to a boil, grate cheeses and toss together to mix, then divide into three piles. Approimately 3 cups for the sauce,
            1 1/2 cups for the inner layer, and 1 1/2 cups for the topping.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Sprinkle in flour and whisk to combine. Mixture will look like very wet sand.
            Cook for appoximately 1 minute, whisking often. Slowly pour in about 2 cups or so of the milk/half and half, while whisking constantly,
            until combined and smooth.</li>
        <li>Continue to heat over medium heat, whisking very often, until thickened to a very thick consistency. It should almost be
            the consistency of a semi-thinned out condensed soup.</li>
        <li>Remove from the heat and stir in spices and 1 1/2 cups of the cheeses, stirring to melt and combine. Stir in another 1 1/2 cups
            of cheese, and stir until completely melted and smooth.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine drained pasta with cheese sauce, stirring to combine fully. Pour half of the pasta mixture
            into the prepared baking dish. Top with 1 1/2 cups of grated cheeses, then top that with the remaining pasta mixture.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the top with the last 1 1/2 cups of cheese and bake for 15 minutes, until cheese is bubbly and lightly golden brown.</li>

    </ol>
