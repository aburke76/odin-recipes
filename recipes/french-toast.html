    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Good morning. It's Saturday, 7:00am. You are the only one awake.
        You and your spouse each had a long week at work, and your teenage kids are exhausted
        from all of their homework and after-school activities. You get the sudden feeling to do something
        special for them. You want to make french toast for breakfast.</p>
        
    <p>The best part? Your family isn't expecting such a delicious surprise, and they definitely
        aren't expecting you to use the best recipe in existence.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/4 cup milk   </li>
        <li>4 slices bread</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Beat egg, vanilla, and cinammon with a whisk in a shallow dish.
            Stir in milk.</li>
        <li>Dip bread in egg mixture, turning to coat both sides evenly.</li>
        <li>Cook bread slices on lightly-greased nonstick griddle on medium heat until browned on both sides.
            Serve with whip cream, syrup, and/or fresh fruit.</li>

    </ol>
    <p>Bam, there you go. Your family will forever refer to you as "Captain F. Toast," but it's well worth it.</p>
